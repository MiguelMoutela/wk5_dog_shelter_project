You can use Google Slides if you don't have powerpoint/keynote.
Presentation structure:
- your planning
- your experience
- favourite bits of code / challenges / bugs

- questions

If you're unclear about any of that, I'm happy to answer questions.

PS: Those of you that haven't, send us your songs or you will suffer through Peter Andr√© or Barbie Girl.




1 - Felt this was a surprisingly hard week. Even if if is just a pizza shop with some buttons and an extra bit of
functionality. I was counting on feeling the that it become easier to produce this kind of communication
with a database but I struggled. For sure we are not getting worse so ey oh, as Darren puts it. Enough complaining
let me show you my app - a one to many dog shelter.

2 - User needs
    - Simple to use app; Intuitive user paths that avoid option paralysis.
    - An app that uses simple english - only international english - no techy jargon
    - An app that limits user input and user limits user error by making use of scroll down selectors
    wherever possible.
    - An app that stores info on owners to increase the chances of the animal's outcome.

3 - Nav bar

4 - Dog with no owner - give it one with lots of dogs. show you can go back and forward.
